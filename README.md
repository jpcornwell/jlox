In this repo I will be folowing along with the first half of the book Crafting
Interpreters by Bob Nystrom. I will simply be mimicking the interpreter
detailed in the book and writing solutions to the challenges at the end of
each chapter.

I won't spend a huge amount of time on the challenges because I feel like many
of these would actually be great candidates for future projects, and I would
like to set aside more dedicated time to delve deeper into them.

After this project, I plan on doing many more compiler and interprter based
projects including going through the second half of Crafting Interpreters.
